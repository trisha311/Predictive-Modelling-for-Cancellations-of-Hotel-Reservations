## Predictive-Modelling-for-Cancellations-of-Hotel-Reservations

With the rise of online bookings and increased ease in finding and making hotel reservations, hotels are faced with increased numbers of cancelled reservations and financial losses due to unused rooms, reduced room rates, and commission charges from discount travel sites.

I have constructed linear classification models, random forest classifier models, and k nearest neighbor models for predicting whether a specific reservation will be cancelled based on guest and reservation details.

## About the Dataset
The dataset contains:
-  Details on 119,390 hotel reservations made between 2015 and 2017 from one city hotel and one resort hotel in Lisbon, Portugal 
-  31 features, including information concerning the dates, requests on the reservations, and demographics of the guests

This dataset was collected by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida, and Luis Nunes for their article [*Hotel Booking Demand Datasets*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) in Elsevier. Both their article and data can be found in the link above.
